Write a program to print out Collatz sequence for a user-supplied number. Prompt the user for a positive integer which will become the first number in the sequence.

•	If previous number is odd, the next number is 3 times the previous, plus 1.
•	If previous number is even, the next number is half of the previous.

After printing a Collatz sequence, your program should ask the user if they want to print out another sequence. The loop will continue until user decides to quit.

Sample Run:
----------- 
Enter a positive number, or zero to quit: 57
   57  172   86   43  130
   65  196   98   49  148
   74   37  112   56   28
   14    7   22   11   34
   17   52   26   13   40pr
   20   10    5   16    8
    4    2    1
It took 32 iterations to arrive at 1.
The average value is 51.66

Enter the next positive number, or zero to quit: 11
   11   34   17   52   26
   13   40   20   10    5
   16    8    4    2    1
It took 14 iterations to arrive at 1.
The average value is 18.50

Enter the next positive number, or zero to quit: 0

Have a nice day!
